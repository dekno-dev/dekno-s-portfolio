            Hello! I'm dekno. I'm 16 years old. I'm a high school student currently studying web and mobile application development. <br>
            I've always been passionate about game development, and have been learning lua for 5+ years now. <br>
            I also have experience in HTML, CSS, C and Java. <br>
            I focus on creating modular, easy to maintain systems that can be expanded upon in the future. <br>
            I’m reliable, detail-oriented, and always eager to learn new technologies. <br>

            <br>

            The current passion project I'm working on is called "Curselocked", a game inspired by the anime "Jujutsu Kaisen". <br>
            It is being developed by a team of highly skilled devs, and I am responsible for managing them as well as coding various systems in the game. <br>
            
            <br>

            If you have any questions or want more clips of my work, feel free to reach out! :)

            I've worked on serveral projects over the years, both solo and collaborative. <br>
            I've built a plethora of systems ranging from:

                    This project tries to replicate the world generation seen in Minecraft.<br> 
                    It uses Perlin Noise to generate a height map, which is then used to generate chunks.<br>
                    It also includes actors for multi-threading support, allowing for smoother performance while generating the world in the background.<br>

                    This project was supposed to be a Ultra Kill like game made in Roblox.<br>
                    It features versatile movement such as: wall-running, dashing, double jumping, and more.<br>
                    It also features a weapon system that allows for different types of weapons to be added easily.<br>
                    However, it was discontinued due to the passion of it shifting to another project.
